            "Deep Sea Rod casts 20 blocks. Perfect for swordfish hunting.",

            "Fire and Ice Rods have special abilities other epic rods don't.",

        "Rare rods catch rare fish. That's fishing 101.",
        "Fish have preferences: near the shore or in the open water.",
        "Valuable fish stay far from shore. Distance matters!",
        "Bigger fish need stronger rods. Check the weight limits.",
        "Try using sardines as bait to catch other fish.  That or sell them for some ale!",
        "Groupers need Carbon Fiber Rods or something better - they're up to 300 pounds!",
        "Swordfish stay deep. Deep Sea casters required.",
        "Great Whites need Onyx Rod or better. They're massive.",
        "Gold Swordfish? 20+ block cast range or forget it.",
        "If you are looking for bait fish, the beach is the best place to find them.",
        "Bait increases your catch rate. The more bait you have, the better your catch rate.",
        "Bait size matters. The bigger the bait, the better the catch rate.",
        "The old dock posts are a great place to find grouper when they come to shore.",
